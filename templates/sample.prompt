Can you implement exactly one function for me in Python whose name is `fibonacci` that takes in the arguments specified below and returns the type specified below. This function should do exactly as the docstring says which is also described below.

Arguments:
- `n` that is of type `int`,
- `a` that is of type `float`,
- `b` that is of type `float` with a default value of `None`

Return type:
- `int`

Docstring:
"Return the n-th fibonacci number."

Can you please only return the function implementation and not return any other text other than that? (Not even the "Sure, here's the implementation")
